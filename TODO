TODO list for zoostrap:
- find out why kains leaves busy resources behind (sometimes rootfs can be
deleted: device or resource busy after ckains completion)
- add -m/--machine option
- add the -d/--distro option
- optionally port to python 2.6/2.7/3.x
- add options for packages lists and obsolete environment vars usage
- add optional configuration file for list of packages and/or executedcommands
- possibly recompile proot-static with a reproducible build, ref below


PRoot compilation:
Currently we rebuild a static proot within a PRooted centos6 in order to
have the least subset of syscalls and larger portability.

The recipe is:
- first build proot on some host:
  apt-get install gcc make libtalloc-devel
  make clean; make all
  cp proot /tmp/proot-step-1
- then run proot proot-static-build on centos6
  git clone https://github.com/proot-me/proot-static-build.git
  cd proot-static-build
  mkdir rootfs-centos6
  cd rootfs-centos6
  wget -O centos-6-root.tar.xz https://github.com/CentOS/sig-cloud-instance-images/raw/20732d1bb34a9aba45c1c6f41576ed6bf3d8c619/docker/centos-6-root.tar.xz
  tar xvJf rootfs-centos6
  cd ..
  # prepare source archive, change version in src/cli/proot.h
  # update GNUmakefile to point to packages/proot-<version>.tar.gz
  proot -R centos-6-build make proot
  cp proot proot-x86_64  # static version
