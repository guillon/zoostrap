# Synopsys

The zoostrap utility is a simple tool for bootstraping a Linux host
distribution and running command in an unprivileged container.

Actually this tool proceeds in three steps:
- download a reference distribution archive an extract into the specified
rootfs dir
- execute installation of additional packages into this rootfs with `PRoot`_
- execute actual commands into this rootfs with `ckains`_

The list of available distributions is currently:
- Ubuntu 12.04 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=ubuntu ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04)
- Ubuntu 14.04 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=ubuntu ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04)
- CentOS 5 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=centos ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=5)
- CentOS 6 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=centos ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=6)
- CentOS 7 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=centos ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=7)
- Fedora 20/21/22/23 (ZS_DISTRIB_ID=fedora ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=20/21/22/23)

This tool is still a prototype and as of now configuration is passed through
the environment, refer to the TODO file for next steps.

# Download

Download a specific release from the release page:
https://github.com/guillon/zoostrap/releases

Or download the last stable version from there:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap

For instance:

    $ wget -O ~/bin/zoostrap https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap
    $ chmod +x ~/bin/zoostrap

The first command gets the zoostrap tool and the second command sets execution bit.

# Examples

A typical usage is to bootstrap for instance a CentOS or Ubuntu distribution and then
execute a build command into the installed distribution root tree.

For instance, assuming  zoostrap is available in the path:

    $ env ZS_DISTRIB_ID=ubuntu ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04 \
      ZS_DISTRIB_PACKAGES="wget" \
      zoostrap rootfs
    $ rootfs/.zoostrap/run wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap
    ...

The first command installs a Ubuntu 12.04 core root tree in the rootfs/
directory and install the wget package.

The second command executes a wget command in the just installed distro.

One can also do this with a single command, passing the command to execute as parameter:

    $ env ZS_DISTRIB_ID=ubuntu ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04 \
      ZS_DISTRIB_PACKAGES="wget" \
      zoostrap rootfs wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap
    ...

# Build and Install

This script requires bash and wget packages and should work on any Linux
distribution for x86_64 architecture with a kernel >= 3.0.

The script can be used directly without installation.

A makefile is provided for completion and testing purpose.

Build with:

    $ make all # a no-op actually

Run unittests with:
