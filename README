# Synopsys

The zoostrap utility is a simple tool for bootstraping a Linux host
distribution into a ckains container, installing packages and running
commands in the container. Refer to ckains for details on the actual
container tool used by default.

The list of supported distributions is currently:
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04
- CentOS 7

This tool is still a prototype and as of now configuration is passed through
the environment, refer to the TODO file for next steps.

# Download

Download the last stable version from there:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap

# Examples

A typical usage is to bootstrap for instance a CentOS 7 distribution and then
execute a build command into the installed distribution root tree.

For instance, download zoostrap and ckains and execute:

    $ env ZS_DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu ZS_DISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04 \
      ZS_DISTRIB_PACKAGES="wget" KAINS_EXE=./ckains \
      ./zoostrap rootfs
    $ ./ckains -R rootfs -- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/zoostrap/master/zoostrap
    ...

The first command installs a Ubuntu 12.04 core root tree in the rootfs/
directory and install the wget package.

# Build and Install

This script requires bash, curl and a container execution tool such as ckains;
kains or proot.

The script can be used directly without installation.

A makefile is provided for completion and testing purpose.

Build with:

    $ make all # a no-op actually

Run unittests with:

    $ make check

Install with, for instance:

    $ make install PREFIX=$HOME/local  # Default is PREFIX=/usr/local
